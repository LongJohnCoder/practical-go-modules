# Practical Go Modules

Dependency management is hard, in any programming language. Go 1.11 introduced Go Modules, the standard package manager for Go projects. With Go Modules you can declare and automatically download dependencies on external packages based on semantic versioning leading to a more reliable, reproducible builds of your software.

In this course, we’ll discuss the benefits of using Go Modules and demonstrate how to effectively use the tooling to tackle challenging dependency management problems you might encounter in your own projects. Moreover, you’ll learn about migration strategies if you are planning to transition from another, open source package manager.
